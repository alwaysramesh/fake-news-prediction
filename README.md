📰 Fake News Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based web application developed to classify news articles as either fake or real. With the rise of misinformation, especially on social media, it's crucial to have tools that can detect fake news and ensure the authenticity of information.

🔍 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create a smart system that can analyze the title and content of a news article and predict whether the news is genuine or false. This can be used by journalists, students, or even casual readers to verify the credibility of any news.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Naive Bayes Classifier: A fast and efficient algorithm for text classification that works well with CountVectorizer.

Decision Tree Classifier: Helps in understanding decision paths based on keyword importance.

Both models are trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated for accuracy.

🧰 Tools and Technologies
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning

Jupyter Notebook for training and experimenting with models

Scikit-learn for vectorization and classification

Flask to build the web interface for the user

HTML/CSS for frontend design

GitHub for version control and code sharing

💡 Features of the Project
User-friendly web interface to input title and text of any news

Shows whether the news is fake or real with one click

Model trained using real-world dataset for better accuracy

Fully open-source and easy to improve or customize

🌐 Live Demonstration
You can run the web application locally using Flask. The user simply enters the news title and content, and the model gives a real-time prediction.
